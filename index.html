  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
          
          <p>For my Dragon project, I had my girlfriend review my website and give me feedback. She told me she thought that it looked great but that I needed to take the image off the bottom of every page. I explained I planned on making it a slideshow, but she's right, there was no reason to have the same slideshow on every page, so I only kept it on my homepage. On my history page, she said that the table at the bottom needed some work, so I adjusted it and gave it a background consistent with the rest of my site. On my FAQ page, she said that the text in the panel should have space around it, so I added that as well. The last suggestion she had was when I did the report a problem email it wasn't pulling up my email, so I added that in. I think these suggestions really improved my site!</p>
          
          <p>This semester, I feel like I gained a solid grasp of the topics we discussed in class. I feel like I obtained the building blocks I need to create a professional looking website. I learned that google is my best friend when it comes to coding and basically any question I had, or problems I ran into, I was able to find someone on a forum with the exact same problem and troubleshoot from there. I will say, before I started the project, I was confident but as soon as I sat down to do it, I felt completely lost, like I had just forgotten how to do everything we had been learning all semester. As I played around with everything though, everything started clearing up for me.</p>
          
           <p>I would say the most challenging parts for me were positioning and flexbox, but with trial and error, I finally got everything placed where I wanted. As I worked through it, all of the pieces started coming together and the positioning started making more sense. I realize my website isn't perfect and there are definitely plenty of things to critique about it, but with it being my first full website, I'm pretty proud of myself and the way this project turned out. 
          </p>

    Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement
  </h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is basically what we have been doing in class all semester: creating rich html, then styling with CSS, then introducing Javascript. Progressive enhancement focuses on the content, because without it, there would be no page. Progressive enhancement is important because makes sites more accessible by letting less capable browsers still display the actual content of the page. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Link to another article on Progressive Enhancement</a>
